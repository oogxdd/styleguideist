## Pre-rendering

By default, Next.js **pre-renders** every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.

Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. (This process is called _hydration_.)

### Two forms of Pre-rendering

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- [**Static Generation (Recommended)**](#static-generation-recommended): The HTML is generated at **build time** and will be reused on each request.
- [**Server-side Rendering**](#server-side-rendering): The HTML is generated on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form you'd like to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

We **recommend** using **Static Generation** over Server-side Rendering for performance reasons. Statically generated pages can be cached by CDN with no extra configuration to boost performance. However, in some cases, Server-side Rendering might be the only option.

You can also use **Client-side Rendering** along with Static Generation or Server-side Rendering. That means some parts of a page can be rendered entirely by client side JavaScript. To learn more, take a look at the [Data Fetching](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching.md#fetching-data-on-the-client-side) documentation.
