In designing a Movie Booking System, we'll follow the steps outlined in your brief.
 
  **Step 1: User's Goal and Required Flow**
 
  The user's goal is to browse movies, select a movie, pick a seat and time, and pay for the tickets.

  **Flow:**
  1. User opens the application
  2. User browses for the desired movie
  3. User chooses a movie
  4. User selects a suitable time
  5. User picks a seat(s)
  6. User proceeds to the payment
  7. Confirmation is displayed after successful completion of payment



  **Step 2: Necessary Pages*

  1. Homepage
  2. Movies Page
  3. Movie Details Page (time, location, and seating chart)
  4. Payment Page
  5. Confirmation Page


  **Step 3: 'Organisms', 'Molecules', and 'Atoms'

  ** - *Homepage Organism:* Search Bar, Featured Movies, Upcoming Movies - *Molecules:* Movie Thumbnails(Tiles), Search Input Field and Button - *Atoms:* Image (Movie Poster), Text (Movie Title), Search Icon, Input Field - *Movies Page Organism:* Filter Options, Movie List - *Molecules:* Filter Options, Movie Cards - *Atoms:* Text (Genres, Ratings, etc.), Checkbox, Images (Posters), Text (Movie Titles, Descriptions) - *Movie Details Page Organism:* Movie Information, Showtimes, Seating Chart, 'Continue' Button - *Molecules:* Movie Header, Time Slot Buttons, Seat Icons, ‘Continue’ button - *Atoms:* Movie Title Text, Duration Text, Rating Text, Back Button, Time Slot Buttons Text, Unselected and Selected Seat Icon - *Payment Page Organism:* Payment Information Form, 'Make Payment' Button - *Molecules:* Input Fields (Card Number, Name, CVV, Exp.

This layout's sequence represents the order in which a user would typically navigate the app. Each individual 'organism' should be spaced appropriately, balancing both aesthetics and usability, to ensure an intuitive and fluid UX.
